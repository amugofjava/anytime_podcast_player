I would really appreciate all feedback - positive and negative - as it both helps improve Anytime and prioritise new features.

#### Building from source

If you do not already have the Flutter SDK installed, follow the instructions from the
Flutter site [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To build from source fetch the latest from master:

```
git clone https://github.com/amugofjava/podcast_search.git
```

From the anytime directory fetch the dependencies:

```
flutter packages get
```

Then either run:

```
flutter run
```

Or build:

```
flutter build apk
```


## Built With

Anytime makes use of several amazing packages available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). Below is a list of the packages that
are heavily used within the application.

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - SDK.
* [Sembast](https://pub.dev/packages/sembast) - NoSQL persistent store.
* [RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) - adds additional capabilities to Dart Streams and StreamControllers.
* [Audio Service](https://pub.dev/packages/audio_service) - Provides background support for supporting audio libraries.
* [Podcast Search](https://pub.dev/packages/podcast_search) - Provides podcast search and parsing.

## Architecture

![architecture.png](docs/architecture_small.png)

Anytime takes a layered approach:

* UI - The UI presented to the users. Currently this is mobile, but could be extended to web and/or desktop in the future.
* BLoC - Handles the state for the UI. Communication between the UI and BLoC is entirely via Sinks and Streams.
* Services - Interacts with the API and Repository to provide data handling routines to the BLoCs and other services.
* API - Interacts with the iTunes API (via a package) to fetch and parse podcast data.
* Repository - Provides persistent storage.
